# Landscape Generator

This code will be used in Autodesk Maya to generate a random mountain landscape.

[Here is the link to my repository.](https://github.com/festeringnewt/Final-Project-Maya-Landscape-Generator)

## Features

- By running the script, the code will generate a mountain lanscape from a plane
- The code will ask the user's input for plane width, height, peaks, and smoothness

## Challenges

- I have no experience scripting in Maya, so I will have to learn from scratch.
- I will have to read the maya.cmds cibrary documentation as well as do my own research on how to use proceduralism in maya.

## Outcomes

### Ideal Outcome
The ideal outcome is to be able to run the script in an empty Maya workspace, and will generate an aesthetically pleasing mountain landscape based on the user's input.

### Minimal Viable Outcome
This is a relatively short script, and most of the work I will be doing is learning the maya.cmds library, so my minimum viable outcome is just for my script to be able to properly generate the procedural art.
