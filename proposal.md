# Snake Game

This code will simulate the popular game snake using pygame.

[Here is the link to my repository.](https://github.com/festeringnewt/Final-Project-Snake-Game)

## Features

- The user will be able to change the direction of the snake character
- The snake's tail will get longer as the snake consumes more particles
- The game will keep track of how many particles the snake has consumed
- The color(s) of the snake character will change based on how many particles the player has consumed.
- If I can, the snake character will be able to go off one side of the screen and appear at the other side

## Challenges

- I will need to research more pygame features
- I will need to know how to keep track of where surfaces are on the screen
- I will need to know how to create a screen grid for the game
- I will need to know how to make a win/lose loop in my game

## Outcomes

### Ideal Outcome
The ideal outcome is to have a functioning snake game that displays score, a lose screen, and a win screen. The game should run smoothly and be aesthetically pleasing.

### Minimal Viable Outcome
The game should have all the basic functions of snake, the player being able to control the snake and the tail getting longer as teh player consumes more particles, and particles being randomly generated on the screen.
